In this article, we propose a design for phase I-II clinical trials that combine two cytotoxic agents with continuous dose levels. The paper is currently under review. [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14231.pdf) is the link to the pre-print. 

In this repository, we have uploaded all the R codes we used to produce the outputs, including the R envoronments after running 1000 simulated trials. The outputs are produced with the R-markdown named "operating_characteristics_paper.Rmd". This files uses .csv files located in the branch "intermediate_outputs". Our advice is to download all the files in the main branch in a folder and then all the .csv files from the intermediate_outputs branch in a separate folder with the same name as the branch.
