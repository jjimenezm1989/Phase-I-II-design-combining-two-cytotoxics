### Authors: José L. Jiménez (jose_luis.jimenez@novartis.com) and Mourad Tighiouart (mourad.tighiouart@cshs.org)

In this article, we propose a design for phase I-II clinical trials that combine two cytotoxic agents with continuous dose levels. The paper is currently under review. [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14231.pdf) is the link to the pre-print. 

In this repository, we have uploaded all the R codes we used to produce the outputs, including the R envoronments after running 1000 simulated trials. The outputs are produced with the R-markdown.
